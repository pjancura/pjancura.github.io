        <p class="introStory">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first took the initiative to start
          learning to code through a Udemy course a year ago. It has been fun
          building the various projects, as they solidify what I am learning
          from the curriculum. Also, even though my degree isnâ€™t in Computer
          Science or Business, I have proven that I can adapt to new fields and
          be successful. Through the Cleveland Codes Software Developers Academy
          at Cuyahoga Community College, I have further enhanced my skills with
          Python, MySQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
