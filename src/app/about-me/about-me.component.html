      <p class="introStory">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first took the initiative to start
        learning to code through a Udemy course a year ago. It has been fun
        building the various projects, as they solidify what I am learning
        from the curriculum. Also, even though my degree isnâ€™t in Computer
        Science or Business, I have proven that I can adapt to new fields and
        be successful. Through the Cleveland Codes Software Developers Academy
        at Cuyahoga Community College, I have further enhanced my skills with
        Python, MySQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
