It has been fun building the various projects, as they solidify what I am learning from the curriculum. Also, even though my degree isnâ€™t in Computer Science or Business, I have proven that I can adapt to new fields and be successful. Through the Cleveland Codes Software Developers Academy at Cuyahoga Community College, I have further enhanced my skills with Python, MySQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS."
